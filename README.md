# Blackjack-Card-Counting

This small project uses a basic card counting strategy to test the viability over a long period of time.

It allows millions of games of blackjack to be played, with a shoe of a pre-specified number of decks and shuffled when getting empty.

It is designed to either up the stake when the table is "hot", or sit out of hands entirely until the table count is favourable.
